3.0.5
Using the gsoap version to identify if the custom serializaton has to be forced or not.
https://www.genivia.com/changelog.htm reports for Version 2.8.98 (02/16/2020)
    Updated the WS-Security and WS-Trust APIs that use SAML with higher precision timestamps in microseconds,
    using the custom/struct_timeval.h serializer for xsd__dateTime. 
    The WS-Security and WS-Trust updates require compiling and linking with custom/struct_timeval.c.
This library forces the WSSE usage to enable secure soap communications.
